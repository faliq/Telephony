Free Contact Centre Solution
============================
This is an Asterisk PBX system based free telephony software I have created with CTI as well as IVR to welcome the telephone callers 
and record the phone conversations as well as computer screen in audio/video files for quality assurance and training of staff. 

This software can also be integrated with facebook/emails to bring up all the calling customers' text-communication along with
their telephone conversation history and call recordings, this can also record calls from hosted PBX systems.

The notification icon (i.e. yellow STAR at bottom-right) shows that calls and computer screen recording software is running.
When there is a call, notification icon starts blinking/recording the telephone conversation as well as computer screen.

At the end of conversation, call details record (i.e. CDR), audio and video files are generated.

Please contact for support, further information, or to have this software customized, thank you.
